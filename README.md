# stake-finality-overhead-simulation
A quick interactive illustration of the connection between Ethereum's minumum effective stake, the finality time and the network overhead.

For background info on that topic refer to [this](https://eth2book.info/capella/part2/incentives/staking/) chapter in Ben Edgington's Eth2Book and [this](https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/serenity_design_rationale#Why-32-ETH-validator-sizes) post of Vitalik.
